# adventofcode-2018

The solutions are written with the following goals:

1. **Readability** Code is more often read than written.
2. **Less is more** Write as little code as possible. The code written today is your obligation tomorrow. Less code, less work.
3. **Speed** Try to be as fast as possible. At least inform your user about intent and progress

## Usage

Run each day using the runday.sh script and the day number. You must provide input at stdin.

Example for Day1:

`runday.sh 01 < data/01.txt`
